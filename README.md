# CodePen Enhancement Suite

A Chrome extension meant to enhance the CodePen experience. Like [RES](https://github.com/honestbleeps/Reddit-Enhancement-Suite).

## Current features:
* Resizable Pen previews when in `Editor View`
* Disable custom CSS on profile pages _(todo: make this togglable)_
* Access editor settings from the Pen Settings modal while in the `Editor View.`
* Set custom slug hashes for Pens (changes the URL on public Pens)
