# CodePen Enhancement Suite

A Chrome extension meant to enhance the CodePen experience. Like [RES](https://github.com/honestbleeps/Reddit-Enhancement-Suite).

## Current Features
* Resizable Pen previews when in `Editor View`
* Toggle custom CSS on CodePen PRO user's profile pages
* Access editor settings from the Pen Settings modal while in the `Editor View.`
* Set custom slug hashes for Pens (changes the URL on public Pens)

## Current To-Do's

### Real Soon
* Fix Pen resize handle coloring on light themes
* Add GUI for enabling/disabling JS on CodePen (probably via Page Action popup)

### Down the road kinda stuff
* Try to figure out a way to handle Editor settings if viewing someone else's Pen or when working on an unsaved Pen.
* Allow user control over which modules are loaded
* Add comment preview functionality 
* Add a visual indicator for notifications (probably won't do this, CodePen's working on it themselves)
* Figure out a way to prevent the comments modal from getting smushed by the Pen Preview resizer (meh)
